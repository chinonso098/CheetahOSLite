Building a Dektop environment in the web browser

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.0.

## Development server
Run `npm install` to install all the needed pacakges

Run `npm run build` to generate the filesystem(index.json). index.json is present, so this step can be skipped.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
